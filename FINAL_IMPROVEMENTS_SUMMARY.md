# 🎯 Final Improvements Summary: Smartphone Addiction Predictor

## 📊 **Issues Addressed**

### **1. Text Visibility Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Improvement banner text was barely visible due to poor color contrast
- **Solution**: Added explicit dark green color (`#155724`) to all text elements in the improvement banner
- **Result**: Text is now clearly visible against the light green background

### **2. Feature Redistribution** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Problem**: Screen_Time_Ratio had 30.3% importance, which you wanted distributed to other features
- **Solution**: Created redistributed model without Screen_Time_Ratio, distributing its importance across other features
- **Result**: Even better balance achieved

## 🚀 **Final Results Achieved**
